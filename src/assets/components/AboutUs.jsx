        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <p>Every journey begins with a spark — ours ignited from a deep love for exploration and the desire to make travel meaningful. Born from late-night travel stories, missed trains, breathtaking sunsets, and the thrill of the unknown, our platform was built by wanderers, for wanderers. What started as a small idea among friends has grown into a trusted travel hub connecting thousands of curious souls with authentic, unforgettable experiences. Over the years, we've helped travelers explore hidden gems, engage with local cultures, and rediscover the joy of the journey itself.</p>
        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>We believe that travel is more than just a destination — it’s a transformation. Our mission is to inspire and empower people to explore the world with purpose, curiosity, and care. Whether it's a solo escape, a backpacking adventure, or a cultural deep dive, we aim to make every trip personal, enriching, and sustainable. We strive to bridge cultures, support local communities, and foster responsible tourism through thoughtfully curated experiences and real-time traveler support.</p>
        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p>We envision a world where travel is a force for connection, growth, and good. A world where every traveler becomes a storyteller, every journey leaves a positive footprint, and every experience builds a more compassionate global community. Our vision is to be the go-to platform for conscious, adventurous travelers — blending technology, passion, and authenticity to redefine how we explore the planet.</p>
